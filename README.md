The objective here was to train ML-model that will predict whether a user will perform one of the target actions with **ROC-AUC > 0.65** and wrap it into application like FastAPI or Flask.
Among the target actions are such as: applying for a car, starting a dialog, subscribing, requesting a callback & etc.

This was the machine learning task with a teacher â€“ binary classification

Initially there were 2 datasets

1. with 1.8 mln records for raw data
2. with 15.7 mln records for target actions data
   
After processing and encoding I got a dataset with 1.7 mln records 
In the 'dataset' folder I have provided a sample from processed dataset with 1000 rows.
